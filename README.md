WebRTC native C++ to browser PeerConnection example
===============================================

This is a fork of the original code from https://github.com/auscaster.
Modified to build and run with webrtc as of Jan 2015.
Tested with Firefox (35.0) and Chrome (Version 39.0.2171.99).
On Firefox I was successful accessing the native-to-browser-test.html
page whether it was as a local file or through a server.
On Chrome I found that the video only worked when I accessed
the page through a server.
